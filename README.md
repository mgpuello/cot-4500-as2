By using this python program the user will be able to find 1st, 2nd, and 3rd degree of interpolation by using the Neville's Method and the Newton Forward method. In addition the user will be able to create an approximation matrix by using the divided diffence and the Hermite Polynomial approximation.
Finally, the user will be able to find a matrix and vectors of a data set by using the cubic spline interpolation.
